#Classify pedestrians and bicyclists based on their micro-Doppler using deep learning (out of NDA)

Classifying pedestrians and bicyclists based on their micro-Doppler signatures using deep learning involves leveraging advanced neural network architectures to analyze the unique frequency shifts caused by the movement of these individuals. By training deep learning models on labeled datasets containing micro-Doppler signatures of pedestrians and bicyclists, the system learns to distinguish between the two classes with high accuracy. This application holds great potential for enhancing surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and other scenarios where accurate real-time detection and classification of moving objects are crucial.
